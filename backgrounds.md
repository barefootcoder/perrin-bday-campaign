## Protean Backgrounds

You are free to choose any background you want for your character (or make your own), but if you
want to peruse a few backgrounds designed specifically for proteans, here are a few more options.

Remember: choose one ideal, one bond, one flaw, and **two** personality traits.  For this one-shot
in particular, I would avoid any of the ideals marked "(Evil)."

### Protean Shifter

All proteans (especially durlans) love to change their shape, but you are particularly fond of it.
You've concentrated on your shifting ability above all others, and it shows.

#### Feature: Flexible Forms
You know how to turn into one form that is smaller than a cat, and you have advantage when trying to
take the form of any mechanical inanimate object that is made of wood and/or glass.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Protean shifters are very mercurial and they are often easily distracted.  However, they are also
very adaptable and most don't let anything faze them.

### Protean Infiltrator

Being a shapeshifter makes proteans a natural fit for reconnaissance and infiltration, but some,
including you, train specially for this field.  You've become an expert at assuming another identity
and fooling other people.

<div style='margin-top:15px'></div>

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Persuasion. <br/>
**Tool Proficiencies:** Forgery kit, thieves' tools. <br/>
**Equipment:** A small knife, forgery kit, paper, ink, and thieves' tools.

<div style='margin-top:15px'></div>

#### Feature: False Identity
You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and
disguises that allow you to assume that persona.  Additionally, you can forge documents including
official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or
the handwriting you are trying to copy.


#### Suggested Characteristics
Protean infiltrators are typically cunning, quick to action, flexible when shifting forms, and very
good at making friends.  Some are consumed with their missions, while others just like the fun of
using their natural abilities to fool the maximum number of people.

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>


### Protean Bruiser

Shapeshifting isn't the only way to get things done: sometimes you just need to put up a good fight.
You've always loved to fight, and you've gotten particularly good at it after getting some training
under your belt.

<div style='margin-top:15px'></div>

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival. <br/>
**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land). <br/>
**Equipment:** A small knife,  a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece
of a banner), a set of bone dice or deck of cards, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

<div style='margin-top:15px'></div>

#### Feature: Hospitality
Among other proteans, your reputation is well known.  You can find a place to hide, rest, or
recuperate among other proteans, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them.  They will
shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for
you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Most protean bruisers are brash, always eager to join a fight in progress, though few deliberately
try to provoke others.  Most enjoy basking in the glory of their victories, but view their defeats
as something to learn from&#65279;—they'll get 'em next time.
