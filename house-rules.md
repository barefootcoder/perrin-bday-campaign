## House Rules

These are the main house rules that we play with at our table.


### General

#### Natural 20 / Natural 1

A natural 20 (or "crit") always succeeds and a natural 1 (or "fumble") always fails, even on ability
checks and saving throws.  Because, to quote the great B. Dave Walters: "You're never so good you
can't mess up, and you're never so hopelessly outmatched that you can't pull a hail Mary."

#### Repeated Skill Checks

If you fail a skill check, you can immediately try again using the same skill, but the DC will go up.  In order to achieve success, you'll have to figure out a new way to use that skill, and that makes it harder.

#### Short Rests

A short rest takes 10 â€“ 15 minutes.

#### Inspiration

Spending inspiration (for yourself or someone else) grants a reroll instead of advantage.


### Combat

#### Action Types

You can "swap" any type of action for a "smaller" type of action.  That is, you can always use a bonus action instead of an action, or an object interaction instead of a bonus action.

#### Delaying Your Turn

In addition to readying an action, you can delay your turn.  You get your full turn, but you cannot interrupt another person's action, and your initiative changes to the delayed position.

#### Critical Damage

When you get a crit on an attack, figure out _all_ the dice you need to roll (including sneak attack damage, smite damage, etc), then roll twice as many dice.  After you roll, you can pick any one of the dice and change it to the highest number possible for that die.
